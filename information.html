                    <h3> Hellow my name is Miracris Mojica</h3>
                    <p>I was born on January 05, 1996, in Dasmarinas Cavite. My parents are Raul(deceased) and Cristina, I have three younger siblings the two of theme are staying with my grandma in Cavite while my sister is staying with us with my mother. I went primary at Salawag Dasma Elementary School and and we move in my mothers province where in Leyte when I was Grade 5, I finish my elementary in at Liloan So. Leyte. When we migrate here in Cebu because my mother decided to work  and have a life here, I finished my secondary at Bankal National highschool and in college I went to LLCC and i didn’t continue my studies because life back then are very hard for us. So I decided to get job and helping my mother first for our expenses. And now I decided to continue my in college since we have a small business and I have work, I can provide my needs while I study. Well, I’m working at a private company here in Lapu-Lapu City, and 5 years of working as an OSS/TL.
                    </p>So about my hobbies and interest in life, I love watching anime movies or series, or playing online games. When I have a spare time like a day I spent it going outside with friends or my relationship now. I don’t like to talk too much not a talkative person. I really love my personal space that not intrude by others, I don’t like people who really talk too much. I do care for others my sincere is true, I really love helping others who really in needs.
